# Background

A borehole was drilled and a well installed at this location in 2006 as part of investigations studying buried bedrock valley aquifer systems in southern Ontario (Figure 1; Davies et al., 2008).  Seismic geophysical surveys helped to situate this well close to the thalweg of the Caledon East buried bedrock valley.  The Caledon East buried bedrock valley which is believed to be a tributary or re-entrant channel trending roughly west-east into the main Laurentian bedrock valley system situated between Georgian Bay and Lake Ontario (Figure 2 and Figure 3).  Details regarding the sediment stratigraphy within the main Laurentian and tributary valleys and groundwater movement within these features remain sketchy despite the valley having been known for over 100 years (Spencer, 1881; 1890).

The Boston Mills monitoring well is screened within a 20m thick sand and gravel unit (150 to 171 mbgs) situated above shale bedrock.  The interpreted thickness and extent of this basal aquifer (shown as the Scarborough aquifer complex) is illustrated on Figure 5 and Figure 6.

A summary of events and conditions at the site is as follows:
- An initial borehole (BH1) was drilled to the top of a gravel aquifer at 37 mbgs in July 2003 by All-Terrain Drilling;
- The borehole started flowing from 37 m depth during drilling, expelling water and sediment into the air (initial hydraulic head was on the order of 18 to 23 m above ground surface);
- Initial flow was estimated at 300 to 500 IGPM but declined to between 90 and 120 IGPM after stabilizing;
- Packing off the borehole within the casing resulted in the two recently capped artesian wells situated within the stormwater ponds to begin to flow again and springs emerged from the area surrounding the borehole;
- Installation and pumping of a relief production well (PW1 drilled by G. Hart and Sons) depressurized the aquifer sufficiently to allow for the initial borehole and springs to be grouted;
- In PW1, bedrock was encountered at a depth of 44 mbgs (45 mASL or 30 m lower than the average Lake Ontario water level);
- Water levels in three shallow monitoring wells (OW1, OW2, OW3) show connection to the deeper aquifer;
- Controlled flow from the relief well (PW1) to a local creek continues to depressurize the aquifer; and
- Monitoring of groundwater levels and flow rates is ongoing.
